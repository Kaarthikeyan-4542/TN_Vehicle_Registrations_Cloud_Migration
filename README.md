# TN_Vehicle_Registrations_Cloud_Migration

The recent project TN_Vehicles_Registration's techincal update :

1.ETL: I migrated the data from python script as a csv file and importeed it into the GCP(Google Cloud PLatform) and leveraged bigquery tool to find metrics.
2.Bigquery: Implemented robust SQL queries to sanitize ingestion errors (using regex) during the upload process
3.Cloud Logic : Adapted on premise SQL Views to Bigquery syntax , to querying the fuel trends and luxury market analytics.

--This Project bridged the gap between 'Data Analytics' and 'Data Engineering' Giving me experience in modern cloud stack.--
